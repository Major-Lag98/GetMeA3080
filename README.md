This webscraper utilizes selenium to automate buying of GPUs. It does this by automating actions on a webbrowser such as Chrome. It is dependent on [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [money parser](https://pypi.org/project/money-parser/).

This was created because my old GTX980 is reaching the end of its life and it's time for retirement. However people all over have been creating bots to buy GPUs off the market and thus creating a worldwide shortage. Because I, and many people like me, cant wait to get a hold of just one of these cards I decided to fight fire with fire.
